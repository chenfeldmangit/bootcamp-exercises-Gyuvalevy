		Israel approves mass surveillance to fight coronavirus
	</h1>
	<h3>
		Shin Bet director says security agency would not use new measure to enforce or supervise quarantine and its
		purpose is to 'save lives'; data will be stored much longer than the 30 days promised by the PM
	</h3>
	<p>
		The government amended and unanimously approved early Tuesday a motion allowing authorities to utilize advanced
		digital monitoring tools to track and surveil Israelis infected with coronavirus.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Shin Bet security agency will document and examine the location patients had visited before entering quarantine or
		being hospitalized and whether they had broken any government directives related to the spread of COVID-19.
	</p>
	<p>
		The technology will allow the Shin Bet to track down people who were at contagion distance from the patient along
		their path and report directly to their phones that they have been exposed to the disease and must enter
		quarantine or get tested for the virus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Special artificial intelligence systems can quickly pinpoint the
		locations of all people who are at risk of exposure and their whereabouts from the point of infection. The
		regulations enable the authorities to collect any digital data, excluding the content of conversations,
		on either the carriers or those exposed to the virus.
	</p>
	<p>
		The measure's implementation does not require a judge's warrant.
